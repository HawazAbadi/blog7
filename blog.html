    <h3>1. Building My Portfolio: Website and Presentation Deck</h3>
    <p>I used GitHub Pages to host my portfolio website. The site mirrors my app's clean, dark-themed UI and organizes content into sections for user research, prototypes, and final reflections. The slide deck complements this by walking viewers through my design journey with structured storytelling.</p>

    <h3>2. Showcasing My Work</h3>
    <p>I focused on clarity and flow. Key insights from user research, design decisions, and usability feedback were spotlighted. Annotated screenshots and before-after slides helped emphasize growth.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>✅ Clear navigation</li>
      <li>✅ Real-time feedback interface</li>
      <li>✅ Scrollable community feed with interaction options</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Lessons Learned About Presentation</h3>
    <p>I learned the value of simplicity and visual storytelling. The deck structure helped me clearly present decisions to non-designers, and rehearsals helped improve delivery.</p>

    <h3>4. Reflecting on My Personal Growth</h3>
    <p>This experience turned me into more than just a designer—I became a storyteller. I learned how to connect with users, explain my thinking clearly, and present a polished, thoughtful experience.</p>
